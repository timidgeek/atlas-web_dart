# Atlas Learns Dart! :dart:

This repository will focus on learning Dart, an open-source, general-purpose programming language developed by Google. Dart is designed to be a versatile language suitable for building a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex, high-performance applications across various platforms. Its focus on performance, productivity, and ease of development makes it a compelling choice for many developers, especially those interested in cross-platform development with Flutter. 

Flutter is a UI framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms. Flutter was developed by Google as well, and it uses Dart as its primary language for writing application code.

## Key Features of Dart: :sparkles:

- <ins>Object-Oriented</ins>
> Dart is an object-oriented language, which means it supports concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.

- <ins>Strongly Typed</ins>
> Dart is statically typed, meaning variable types are explicitly declared and enforced at compile-time, which helps catch errors early in the development process.

- <ins>Just-In-Time (JIT) and Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation</ins>
> Dart supports both JIT and AOT compilation. JIT compilation is used during development for fast edit-refresh cycles, while AOT compilation produces highly optimized native machine code for efficient execution.

- <ins>Asynchronous Programming</ins>
> Dart provides built-in support for asynchronous programming using async and await keywords, making it easier to write code that performs non-blocking I/O operations.

- <ins>Garbage Collection</ins>
> Dart has automatic memory management through garbage collection, which helps manage memory allocation and deallocation, reducing the likelihood of memory leaks.

- <ins>Cross-Platform Development</ins>
> Dart can be used to build applications for various platforms, including web, mobile (iOS and Android), desktop, and server-side applications, through frameworks like Flutter (for mobile and web) and AngularDart (for web).

- <ins>Flutter Framework</ins>
> Flutter is a popular UI framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase using Dart. It provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets, a reactive framework, and hot reload for fast development cycles.

- <ins>Open-Source</ins>
> Dart is open-source, meaning the language specification, compilers, and tools are freely available for developers to use and contribute to.
