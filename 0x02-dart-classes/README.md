Dart is a programming language made by Google. This repository is over classes. Classes in Dart are used to create blueprints for objects.

<ins>Example of inheritance in Dart:</ins>
```
class Animal {
  void eat() {
    print('Animal is eating');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  void bark() {
    print('Dog is barking');
  }
}
```
